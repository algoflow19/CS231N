查看java和JDK版本：
/usr/libexec/java_home -V

(OK) Install the latest version of Bazel as per the instructions on the Bazel website.
(OK)The Android NDK is required to build the native (C/C++) TensorFlow code. The current recommended version is 12b, which may be found here.
(OK)The Android SDK and build tools may be obtained here, or alternatively as part of Android Studio. Build tools API >= 23 is required to build the TF Android demo (though it will run on API >= 21 devices).

Android NDK 是在SDK前面又加上了“原生”二字，即Native Development Kit，因此又被Google称为“NDK”。

Edit WORKSPACE
- The Android entries in <workspace_root>/WORKSPACE must be uncommented with the paths filled in appropriately depending on where you installed the NDK and SDK.
- Also edit the API levels for the SDK in WORKSPACE.


Android SDK Location:
/Users/zhangrao/Library/Android/sdk

Android NDK Location:
/Users/zhangrao/Library/Android/android-ndk-r12b

==== modify tensorflow configuration: file location and api_version
api_level = 25,
build_tools_version = "25.0.3",
path = "/Users/zhangrao/Library/Android/sdk",


path="/Users/zhangrao/Library/Android/android-ndk-r12b",
# This needs to be 14 or higher to compile TensorFlow. 
# Note that the NDK version is not the API level.
api_level=14

x86 means that 32bit and 64bit computers can run it, and x86_64 means that 64bit computers alone can run it.

==== run app on the Android Emulator ====
(1) rebuild the tensorflow libraray with x 86 architecture
bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/contrib/android:libtensorflow_inference.so \
   --crosstool_top=//external:android/crosstool \
   --host_crosstool_top=@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain \
   --cpu=x86

(2) change the cpuType in build.gradle to 'x86'


==== open webcam on Mac
Android Studio: Tools->Android->AVD Manager->pencil->Advanced
