__Abstract__: Object detection is a very important task for different applications including autonomous driving, face detection, video surveillance, etc. CNN based algorithm could be a great solution for object detection with high accuracy. Besides, most current deep learning applications are running on servers or desktop computers. Considering there are a lot of mobile computing devices available, we implemented the CNN based object detection algorithm on Android devices. The model architecture is based on SqueezeNet to get image feature maps and a convolutional layer to find bounding boxes for recognized objects. The total model size is around 8 MB while most other object detection model takes more than 100 MBâ€™s storage. The model architecture makes the calculation more efficient, which enables its implementation
on mobile devices.
